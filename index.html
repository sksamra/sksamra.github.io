		<summary>
			Doctor Who is a British science fiction TV show produced by BBC. The show started in 1963 and stopped airing after 1996 (classical era). The show however, was rebooted in 
			2005 and is still being produced today (new era). The show is about an alien named the Doctor from the Timelord race that are capable of regenerating. The Doctor travels in time and 
			space in his/her ship, the TARDIS, which is disguised as a blue policebox. The Doctor has multiple companions from Earth that help him/her in defeating evil species.

		<h3>Episodes Titles</h3>
		<br>
		<summary>
			Here we see the word clouds of each of the doctor's episode titles, which you are able to choose the actor of the doctor in the drop down menu. From this we 
			can see how the classic era had more numbers in their episode titles as their episodes continued for multiple parts. In addition, Paul McGann
			featured as the Doctor only in one movie which is why he doesn't have many words at all compared to others.
